# Try the software #

The best way to help is to try using JAITools and give us your feedback. See [here](Maven.md) for how to get the latest JAITools release. Alternatively you can try the current development version by downloading the sources and building them with Maven.

# Feedback and questions #

To report bugs or suggest improvements please use the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/jaitools/issues/list). Be sure to include the revision number of the JAITools code that you are working with in your report.

For general questions, wide ranging discussion, and rambling but fascinating explorations of the philosophy underlying our work (and yours) there is the [JAITools mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jai-tools).

Presently, there are no commercial support options for JAITools.

# Code contributions #

Small, informal contributions are very welcome and can be submitted, preferably in the form of a patch, via the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/jaitools/issues/list). Please include a clear description of the context and purpose of your code. If you include unit tests we will really like you.
